# BR_atm
A simple ATM implemented by Zoey Zhu for a coding challenge by Bear Robotics.

Cloned by entering the following code in a console: git clone https://github.com/ElClopitan/BR_atm.git

All code is contained in atm.py:

* A simple bank class
  
* An implementation for an atm
  
* A main function that is run to test the implementation of the atm
  
To run, please navigate to the folder BR_atm and type "python3 atm.py"

The first test case is to show that an empty bank and atm will not allow a user to interact with it.

The list of boolean values is to indicate whether or not it passed certain test cases I wrote.
